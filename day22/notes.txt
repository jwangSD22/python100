the ball is its own object

from main -- it will need to evaluate the ball's position and then reset the movement of the ball
            based on what it touches.


        how will the movement be controlled?

        ball should have an internal heading set-

        at that point, it can move forward x number of paces set by "speedfactor" -- can adjust later
