when the game starts... 



init a variable for location of food
init a snake HEAD


create_random location for food
    this function will keep running until it finds a suitable location 

start a while loop that will keep moving my snake forward

xx  i can bind on screen listeners to allow me to change the heading left or right but the snake will keep going forward

    need to do a check here if snake goes out of screen range or hits itself -- it's game over 

    could i technically used a linked list for this? 

    each frame will have to capture the entire turtle and the frame can be generated using a linked list that forces generation of all the turtle locations with set pos?

    so each frame will be moving the snake head forward 

        check if snake head hits a game over event

        check if snake head eats food
            if snake head has a food item one square ahead of it:
                generate a new food location
                move the snake head forward to that spot to (eat the food)

                cycle thru linked list to add a new tail turtle 
                the new tail will assume the last position of the former last tail item
